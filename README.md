Throughout the day, one experiences several different emotions and moods. The aim of this
project is to track those feelings throughout the day and to display them in an organized fashion
for the user to review. The user will press a button corresponding to the emotion he/she perceives
at any moment throughout the day, the input along with the date and time are logged. The data
is stored, organized, and made accessible to the user via a web portal for analysis. The aim is to
reflect on what emotions the user feels most frequently throughout the day.
